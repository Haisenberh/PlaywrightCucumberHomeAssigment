### Comprehensive Test Automation Strategy for eBooking Application

#### 1. **Understanding the Current Scenario and Challenges**
   - **Long Testing Cycles**: Manual testing is time-consuming, leading to delays in release cycles.
   - **Small Test Coverage in Unit and Integration Tests**: Critical areas of the application are not thoroughly tested, increasing the risk of bugs slipping into production.
   - **No Test Automation**: The absence of automation means that repetitive tasks are done manually, reducing efficiency and accuracy.
   - **Integration Testing Dependencies**: The system interacts with multiple upstream and downstream systems, making it complex to test end-to-end (E2E).

#### 2. **Proposed Test Automation Strategy**

**a. Tool Selection:**
   - **Test Automation Framework**: We will use a robust framework like Playwright for UI automation. It will allow us to test the application in a cross-browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), mobile resolution (iOS, Android), cross-platform, and cross-environment manner.
   - **API Testing Tools**: For API testing we will use Playwright and request fixture. Request fixture will allow us to send any type of HTTP request and receive the response, validate it against the expected response and ensure the request is successful. For manual testing we will use Postman as it is very powerful and easy to use.
   - **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate with Azure or GithubActions  for continuous integration and deployment. Using Playwright and Typescript will allow us to configure the pipeline in advanced way, ensuring a consistent testing environment and fast feedback after every change.

**b. Architecture Overview:**
   - **Master Data**: Ensure data consistency by automating tests for data validation.
   - **Routes**: Automate tests for route availability and correctness.
   - **Pricing**: Validate pricing rules and calculations through automated scripts.
   - **Database**: Implement database testing using tools like DBFit or custom SQL scripts.
   - **Order Fulfillment System**: Automate end-to-end scenarios from booking creation to fulfillment.
   - **Invoicing**: Ensure correct invoicing by validating invoice generation post-order fulfillment.

**c. Implementation Steps:**

**i. Shift-Left Testing Approach:**
   - **Unit Testing**: Unit tests become the part of Definition of Done. Writing unit tests become fundament of our testing strategy. Using frameworks based on Typescript. Playwright will be used to write UI unit tests of components which will be executed on the headless browser with mocking backed response to isolate UI validations. These tests will be very fast to run and will provide instant feedback about UI state at any given point. Critical bussiness logic tests should be covered, like: Pricing rules and calculations, Invoicing validations, order fulfillment validations.
   - **Integration Testing**: 
   Implement integration tests between components:
   - **Master Data to Pricing**
   - **Routes to eBooking**
   - **eBooking to db**: In this case MongoDb instance should be running in order to test eBooking to db integration.
   - **eBooking to Order Fulfillment System**
   - **Order Fulfillment System to Invoicing**
   - If possible REST API integration tests when all backed services is running should be written to cover all endpoints logged in documentation. These tests should be no longer than 5 minutes to provide fast feedback after every code change, and this tests should be able to run locally to give every developer tool with accurate feedback about the state of the application at any given point, to catch bugs even before they were commited to remote repository.
   - **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews focusing on testability and coverage.

**ii. End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
   - **Identify Key Scenarios**: Prioritize critical user journeys such as booking creation, status tracking, and order fulfillment. Create treaceability matrix where manual test cases are mapped to automation tests to not do manual testing twice if functionality is already automated. Calculate ROI (Return On Investment on manual testing and automation) and schedule tests accordingly.
   - **Automate High-Priority Scenarios**: Start with high-risk areas and gradually cover more scenarios. Start with not covered tests that takes long time to perform manually and automate them.
   - **Data Management**: Use test data management tools or libraries to maintain consistent test data across environments.
   - **Environment Setup**: Ensure stable test environments mimicking production as closely as possible. Test data should match production data (except for sensitive information) with security measures in place to find real bugs. Test data should be updated often to find different bugs and not make suite redundant.

**iii. Maximize Test Coverage:**
   - **Increase and track unit test coverage**: Write unit tests for critical bussiness logic to increase test coverage and detect bugs early in the development cycle (static tools analysis)
   - **Add static tools analysis** Adding static tools analysis to detect bugs early in the development cycle
   - **Increase and track integration test coverage**: Write integration tests and use static tools to calculate integration tests coverage
   - **Functional Coverage**: Cover all functional requirements through detailed test cases.
   - **Regression Suite**: Build a comprehensive regression suite to catch any regressions introduced during updates.
   - **Performance Testing**: Incorporate performance tests using tools like JMeter or Gatling to ensure the application can handle expected load.
   - **Security Testing**: Include security checks using tools like OWASP ZAP to identify vulnerabilities.

**iv. Continuous Integration and Deployment:**
   - **Pipeline Setup**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to run tests automatically on code commits.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Provide immediate feedback to developers on test results to facilitate quick fixes.
   - **Monitoring and Reporting**: Use dashboards and reports to monitor test execution and coverage over time.

**v. Problem Solving and Troubleshooting:**
   - **Debugging Tools**: Utilize debugging tools and logs to quickly identify and resolve issues.
   - **Collaboration**: Foster collaboration between developers, testers, and operations teams to address cross-functional challenges.
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Perform thorough root cause analysis for failures to prevent recurrence.

**vi. Best Practices:**
   - **Modularization**: Write modular and reusable test scripts to reduce maintenance efforts. Write Unit, Integration and E2E tests guideline for existing and future contributors to follow one approach as a team and save time on PR reviews. Do internal trainings and workshops to ensure everyone is on the same page.
   - **Documentation**: Document test plans, strategies, and results for future reference and knowledge transfer.

#### 3. **Execution Plan**

**a. Phase 1: Planning and Tool Setup**
   - GAP Analysis: talk with a team, identify gaps, problems, challenges and opportunities
   - Define scope, objectives, and timelines. 
   - Create Test strategy and Test Plan.
   - Present Test Plan and Test Strategy to the team. Gather feedback and adjust strategy if necessary.
   - Select and configure automation tools for unit, integration and e2e tests.
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline. 

**b. Phase 2: Test Design and Development**
   - Identify and prioritize test scenarios.
   - Develop test scripts for both functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Integrate with existing build and deployment processes. Include tests into Ci/CD pipeline as soon as possible. 

**c. Phase 3: Execution and Feedback**
   - Run initial test suites and gather feedback.
   - Refine and optimize test scripts based on feedback.
   - Monitor and report on test coverage and results.

**d. Phase 4: Maintenance and Improvement**
   - Regularly update test scripts to accommodate application changes.
   - Continuously improve test coverage and effectiveness.
   - Conduct periodic reviews to assess strategy effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.
